                ## Trying Unitt
                
                *Unitt* may be splited into two sections: *runner* and *the tests*.
                
                *The runner* is the section responsible to find, run and return error codes to the final user.
                While *the tests* are responsible to group the rules and logic of the tests.
                
                ### Initial setup
                
                It's recomended that your *tester* be at the root of your directory, right before your *tests* folder.
                
                All of your *tests* must begin with the `test` prefix and end with the `.art` extension to be found,
                since you may want to mix them with some other files.
                
                Being that said, that is the right way of setting up your *tester*:
                
                Let's consider that you have the following directory:
                
                ```
                src/
                    ...
                tests/
                    ...
                main.art
                tester.art
                ```
                
                Into your `tester.art`, you must:
                
                ```art
                import {unitt}!
                
                runTests findTests "tests"
                ```
                
                To run it, call:
                
                ```
                arturo tester.art
                ```
                
                > [!TIP] 
                > You may want to use a hashbang to don't need to call arturo for every run.
                
                > [!TIP]
                > If you want be able to test some specific tests from the CLI, you can:
                > ```art
                >  import {unitt}!
                >  
                >  runTests (empty? arg)? 
                >      -> findTests "tests"
                >      -> arg
                > ```
                
                ### The *tests* itself
                
                A real example of tests:
                
                ```art
                import {unitt}!
                
                unix?: true
                
                suite "test binary appending" [
                    test "operation with integer works" [
                        b: to :binary 0
                        assert -> as.binary 2 = append b 1
                        assert -> as.binary 1 = b ++ 1
                    ]
                
                    test.prop "operate binaries with integer returns a binary" [
                        b: to :binary 0
                        assert -> binary? append b 1
                        assert -> binary? b ++ 1
                    ]
                ]
                
                test.skip: unix? "split works for windows's paths" [
                    assert -> ["." "splited" "path"] = split.path ".\\splited\\path"
                ]
                
                test "split is works for unix path" [
                    assert -> ["." "splited" "path"] = split.path "./splited/path"
                ]
                ```
                
                This will show you:
                
                ```
                Suite: test binary appending 
                
                    ❌ - assert that operation with integer works
                         assertion: as .binary 2 = append  1
                
                    ❌ - assert that operation with integer works
                         assertion: as .binary 1 =  ++ 1
                
                    ✅ ~ assert that operate binaries with integer returns a binary
                         assertion: binary? append  1
                
                    ✅ ~ assert that operate binaries with integer returns a binary
                         assertion: binary?  ++ 1
                
                
                ⏩ - assert that split works for windows's paths 
                     skipped!
                
                ✅ - assert that split is works for unix path
                     assertion: ["." "splited" "path"] = split .path "./splited/path"
                ```
                
                > [!NOTE]
                > Property-based tests have `~` as separator. 
                
                ### The *Runner*
                
                Basically, you can run your *tests units* without a *runner*. 
                But there are some reasons why you should prefer to use a `runTests` function to run them.
                
                First, your *runner*'s output will give you important information about the current run.
                This will show you the file being runned, 
                the tests's status
                and at the end a summary of failed, skipped and passed tests:
                
                ```
                ===== Statistics =====
                
                ⏏️   TOTAL: 24 assertions
                ✅  PASSED: 20 assertions
                ⏩ SKIPPED: 4 assertions
                ❌  FAILED: 4 assertions
                
                ===== ========== =====
                ```
                
                Also, the runner is able to return an error code, 
                so that is great if you're working with *Continuous Integration*.
                
                ## Documentation
                
                ### *Runner*
                - `runTests: $[tests [:string]]`:
                    The *runner function*, this executes all `tests`,
                    show statistics and return a value. 
                    - `.failFast`:
                        Fails on the first error found. 
                        This works at file scope due to our current way of running tests.
                    - `.suppress`: 
                        Suppress `panic`, this means: 
                        this won't terminate your tests, 
                        won't return an error code
                        and won't print a `panic` message. 
                - `findTests: $[folder :string]`:
                    The *finder function*, this function will look for *tests* inside the relative `folder`.
                    The default *test* pattern is "test*.art".
                    - `.thatMatches :string`:
                        Defines what is a test-file via a kind-of *glob* pattern.
                        Use a `*` as spliter. 
                        - Obs.: That is a kind-of *glob* pattern, not a real one. 
                          So just use one and only one `*` to split the pre and suffix.
                
                ### *Tests*
                - `test: $[description :string, testCase :block]`:
                    The test case itself, you need to pass a clear description to it,
                    And the logic that you're trying to assert.
                    - `.prop`:
                        Indicates that a test is property-based.
                    - `.skip :logical`:
                        Skips tests for some condition. 
                        If none condition is given, this will just skip the test.
                    - `.static: :block`:
                        Defines what will and what won't be evaluated.
                    - `.static: :logical`:
                        Disable runtime evaluation, and forces static display.
                - `assert: $[condition :block]`:
                    A function that is only available inside the `test` case,
                    makes an assertion given the `condition`.
                - `suite: $[description :string tests :block]`:
                    Visually groups tests together.
