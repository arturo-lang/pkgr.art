                                ### What does this package do?
                                
                                Lanx is a minimal static file server for Arturo. Point it at a folder and it will serve its contents over HTTP - with automatic MIME type detection, directory listings, and `index.html` support; no configuration needed! 😉
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                #### As a CLI tool
                                
                                Just run it from any directory:
                                ```red
                                lanx              ; serves the current directory
                                lanx ./public     ; serves a specific folder
                                ```
                                
                                #### As a library
                                
                                Embed it in your own Arturo project:
                                ```red
                                import'lanx!
                                
                                server: to :lanx []!
                                server\root: "./public"
                                server\port: 8080
                                server\start
                                ```
                                
                                > [!TIP]
                                > Drop an `index.html` in any folder to have it served automatically instead of the directory listing.
                                
                                ### Function reference

                                #### `start`
                                
                                Start the server using the configured `root` and `port`.
                                ```red
                                server: to :lanx []!

                                ### What does this package do?
                                
                                Lanx is a minimal static file server for Arturo. Point it at a folder and it will serve its contents over HTTP - with automatic MIME type detection, directory listings, and `index.html` support; no configuration needed! 😉
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                #### As a CLI tool
                                
                                Just run it from any directory:
                                ```red
                                lanx              ; serves the current directory
                                lanx ./public     ; serves a specific folder
                                ```
                                
                                #### As a library
                                
                                Embed it in your own Arturo project:
                                ```red
                                import'lanx!
                                
                                server: to :lanx []!
                                server\root: "./public"
                                server\port: 8080
                                server\start
                                ```
                                
                                > [!TIP]
                                > Drop an `index.html` in any folder to have it served automatically instead of the directory listing.
                                
                                ### Function reference
                                
                                #### `:lanx` type
                                
                                | Field | Default | Description |

                                #### `start`
                                
                                Start the server using the configured `root` and `port`.
                                ```red
                                server: to :lanx []!
                                server\start

                                ### What does this package do?
                                
                                Lanx is a minimal static file server for Arturo. Point it at a folder and it will serve its contents over HTTP - with automatic MIME type detection, directory listings, and `index.html` support; no configuration needed! 😉
                                
                                ### How do I use it?
                                
                                #### As a CLI tool
                                
                                Just run it from any directory:
                                ```red
                                lanx              ; serves the current directory
                                lanx ./public     ; serves a specific folder
                                ```
                                
                                #### As a library
                                
                                Embed it in your own Arturo project:
                                ```red
                                import'lanx!
                                
                                server: to :lanx []!
                                server\root: "./public"
                                server\port: 8080
                                server\start
                                ```
                                
                                > [!TIP]
                                > Drop an `index.html` in any folder to have it served automatically instead of the directory listing.
                                
                                ### Function reference
                                
                                #### `:lanx` type
                                
                                | Field | Default | Description |
                                |---|---|---|
                                | `root` | current directory | path to serve |
                                | `port` | `18966` | port to listen on |
                                
                                #### `start`
                                
                                Start the server using the configured `root` and `port`.
                                ```red
                                server: to :lanx []!
                                server\start
                                ```
